#About
Built at FOSS United’s FOSS HACK 3.0
 This project is done with the intention of creating a free and open source alternative for Notepad text editor. This application provides us with the ability to create, edit and save files containing text.
The basic working of notepad was the main subject of operation and then adding some new concept to it. Added to the basic features, our initial objective was to incorporate features like  multi copy(copying multiple texts at a time and pasting it in the users’ preferred order) language translator, multiple tabs, merging documents, speech to text, autosave, image to text etc. 
Our project has been implemented finally with the basic menu options for editing, formatting, font  added with the basic file functions.
The interface has been created with the currently existing text editor functions .	The project faced difficulty in implementation stage while working on  couple of the add on features .
